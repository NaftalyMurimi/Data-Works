About Dataset
This dataset contains detailed specifications and official launch prices of various mobile phone models from different companies. It provides insights into smartphone hardware, pricing trends, and brand competitiveness across multiple countries. The dataset includes key features such as RAM, camera specifications, battery capacity, processor details, and screen size.

One important aspect of this dataset is the pricing information. The recorded prices represent the official launch prices of the mobile phones at the time they were first introduced in the market. Prices vary based on the country and the launch period, meaning older models reflect their original launch prices, while newer models include their most recent launch prices. This makes the dataset valuable for studying price trends over time and comparing smartphone affordability across different regions.

Question 
Here are 10 practical test questions based on the dataset:

1. **Data Exploration**: Load the dataset into a DataFrame and display the first five rows. What insights can you gather about the structure and types of data present?

2. **Data Cleaning**: Check for missing values in the dataset. Which columns contain missing values, and how would you handle them?

3. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate the average RAM size and battery capacity of all smartphones in the dataset. What is the mean RAM and battery capacity?

4. **Filtering Data**: Write a query to filter out all smartphones launched in 2020 with a battery capacity of at least 4000 mAh and a screen size of 6.5 inches or more.

5. **Comparing Price Trends**: Plot the average launch price of smartphones in India over the years. What trend do you observe?

6. **Brand Analysis**: Identify the top three brands with the highest average back camera resolution. What are the results?

7. **Feature Correlation**: Compute the correlation between RAM size and launch price. Does a higher RAM generally correlate with a higher price?

8. **Processor Analysis**: Find the most commonly used processor among all smartphones. Which processor appears most frequently?

9. **Price Comparison Across Regions**: Select a smartphone model and compare its launch price across all available countries. Which country had the highest and lowest launch price?

10. **Trend Prediction**: Based on historical data, predict the launch price of a new smartphone with 8GB RAM, a 108MP back camera, a 5000mAh battery, and a 6.7-inch screen. What would be a reasonable estimate?


11. **Outlier Detection**: Identify any outliers in the dataset based on the launch price. What criteria would you use to detect and handle them?  

12. **Market Share Analysis**: Determine which company has released the most smartphone models in the dataset. What does this indicate about their market presence?  

13. **Yearly Analysis**: Find the year with the highest number of smartphone launches. What factors might have contributed to this peak?  

14. **Price vs. Features**: Compare the average price of smartphones with different RAM sizes. How does RAM influence pricing?  

15. **Battery Life Comparison**: Group smartphones by battery capacity range (e.g., <3000mAh, 3000-4000mAh, >4000mAh) and analyze their average launch price. Do phones with larger batteries tend to be more expensive?  

16. **Screen Size Evolution**: Plot the trend of average screen size over the years. Do you notice an increase in smartphone screen sizes over time?  

17. **Premium vs. Budget Phones**: Define a threshold for premium smartphones based on price and compare their average RAM, camera quality, and battery size with budget phones. What major differences do you find?  

18. **Camera Specifications Impact on Price**: Analyze whether a higher back camera resolution correlates with a higher launch price. What conclusions can you draw?  

19. **Regional Price Variation**: Select three different smartphone models and compare their launch prices in different countries. What factors could explain the price differences?  

20. **Predictive Analysis**: Build a simple machine learning model using the dataset to predict the launch price of a smartphone based on its specifications. What features have the most significant impact on pricing?
